                I am a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer specializing in
                Computer Vision and Generative AI. With a solid mathematical foundation and
                broad engineering experience, I build and optimize advanced ML pipelines using GANs,
                transformers, and diffusion models. I focus on improving model performance, and efficiency in
                practical applications. I also value the clear communication of complex ideas across technical and
                non-technical domains.
